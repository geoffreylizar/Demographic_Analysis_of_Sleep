This project was initiated as the final project for COGS 108 at UCSD: Data Science in Practice. The project was completed by Geoffrey Lizar in collaboration with Justin Ferrell, Leann Gamboa, and Stella Seki, all under the supervision of Professor Shannon Ellis. This project sought to discover which demographic groups in America have been losing the most sleep over time, hoping to shed a light on where resources should be directed for study and intervention. A more detailed description, as well as a breakdown of the final analysis can be found in the General_Analysis.ipynb file. 

Special thanks to the CDC for providing a dataset, and to the developers of Python's pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn packages. This project would not be possible without the dedicated effort of these often unsung heroes of the programming world.
